### 2. Backend Development

#### 2.1 AWS Lambda Function

The backend is implemented as a serverless AWS Lambda function using Python:

```python
# Main handler function to process incoming requests
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract parameters from request
    body = json.loads(event.get('body', '{}')) if event.get('body') else event
    body_type = body.get('body_type', 'average')
    occasion = body.get('occasion', 'casual')
    gender = body.get('gender', 'female')
    country = body.get('country', 'global')
    age_range = body.get('age_range', 'adult')
    
    # Generate outfit description using Claude Instant
    outfit_description = generate_outfit_description(body_type, occasion, gender, country, age_range)
    
    # Generate outfit image using Stability AI
    image_url = generate_outfit_image(outfit_description, body_type, occasion, gender, country, age_range)
    
    # Return results
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'headers': {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': True
        },
        'body': json.dumps({
            'outfit_description': outfit_description,
            'image_url': image_url
        })
    }
```

#### 2.2 AI Integration

The Lambda function integrates with two key AI services:

1. **Text Generation (Claude Instant)**
   - Generates detailed outfit descriptions based on user inputs
   - Considers body type, occasion, gender, region, and age appropriateness
   - Uses prompt engineering for optimal results

2. **Image Generation (Stability AI SDXL)**
   - Creates photorealistic outfit visualizations
   - Interprets text descriptions into visual representations
   - Manages prompt construction for optimal image generation

#### 2.3 S3 Integration

Images generated by the AI service are:
1. Stored in a dedicated S3 bucket (`stylegenie-uploads`)
2. Named with unique identifiers based on parameters and timestamp
3. Returned as publicly accessible URLs in the response

### 3. Infrastructure Setup

#### 3.1 AWS Services Configuration

1. **S3 Bucket Setup**
